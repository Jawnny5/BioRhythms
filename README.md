# Biorhythm Calculator

-Developed by a close friend of Dr. Sigmund Freud, Dr. Wilhelm Fleiss in the late 19th century and popularized in the late 1970's in the US, the biorhythmic theory is a pseudoscientific theory that our lives are significantly affected by periodic cycles of 23, 28, and 33 days. 

Biorhythms is a simple application that allows the user to input a user's date of birth and a target date and view the user's emotional, intellectual and physical biorhythms for that specific date.

Using the Progessive Web App Version of the Biorhythm Calculator is easy. Simply visit the deployed application at https://cccmeter.netlify.app/ and use the two drop down menus on the page to enter a user's date of birth and the target date, which can be a date in the past or future. Upon making these selections a chart will dynamically render to show the user information. The green line corresponds to physical biorhythm, the red line to emotional biorhythm and the blue line to intellectual biorhythm.
